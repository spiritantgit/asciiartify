| minikube | Highlights Supports the latest Kubernetes release (+6 previous minor versions) Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) Deploy as a VM, a container, or on bare-metal Multiple container runtimes (CRI-O, containerd, docker) Direct API endpoint for blazing fast image load and build Advanced features such as LoadBalancer, filesystem mounts, FeatureGates, and network policy Addons for easily installed Kubernetes applications Supports common CI environments | miniKube is the most widely used local Kubernetes installer. It offers an easy to use guide on installing  and running single Kubernetes environments across multiple operating systems.  It deploys Kubernetes as a container, VM or bare-metal and implements a Docker API endpoint that helps it  push container images faster. It has advanced features like load balancing, filesystem mounts, and  FeatureGates, making it a favourite for running Kubernetes locally. |
| k3d      | Featured use-cases include:  hot-reloading of code when developing on k3d (Python Flask App) build-deploy-test cycle using Tilt full cluster lifecycle for simple and multi-server clusters Proof of Concept of using k3d as a service in Drone CI                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | What is k3d? k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Lab’s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker. k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes. Note: k3d is a community-driven project but it’s not an official Rancher (SUSE) product.                                                                                                                                           |
| kind     | kind consists of:  Go packages implementing cluster creation, image build, etc. A command line interface (kind) built on these packages. Docker image(s) written to run systemd, Kubernetes, etc. kubetest integration also built on these packages (WIP) kind bootstraps each “node” with kubeadm. For more details see the design documentation.  NOTE: kind is still a work in progress, see the 1.0 roadmap.                                                      | Primarily designed to test Kubernetes,   Kind  (Kubernetes in Docker) helps you run Kubernetes clusters locally and in CI pipelines using Docker containers as "nodes". It is an open source CNCF certified Kubernetes installer that supports highly available multi-node clusters and builds Kubernetes release builds from its source.                                                                                                                                    |
